# FluffyMusicTracker
A generic template for making custom music trackers. The aim of this project is to minimize duplicated effort by providing as much functionality shared between trackers as possible, while also hopefully serving as a functional fakebit tracker on its own.

You can find a preliminary roadmap [here](https://github.com/qreativa/fluffymusictracker/blob/main/doc/roadmap.md).

**WARNING:** This is a heavy WIP! Don't expect to be able to use this just yet.

# Building
Right now, the project only builds on Linux. For this example implementation, you need to install your distribution's Raylib development package, or otherwise provide the library yourself.

To build the project, simply enter the root directory of the project and type:
```
make
```

This will create a new directory called `build` and drop the compiled executable inside.
